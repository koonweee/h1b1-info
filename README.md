## Goal/Problem statement:
Sites like [h1b1data.info](https://h1bdata.info/) exist
to provide information on H-1B petitions and salaries. A similar platform for
H-1B1 visas would be beneficial to employees from Chile and Singapore looking for
opportunities in the US.

## About the H-1B1 visa

The H-1B1 visa is a variant of the more popular H-1B visa that allows employers to temporarily employ foreign workers from Chile and Singapore in the U.S. The H-1B1 visa has a few distinct advantages:
* Employer does NOT need to submit a Form I-129 Petition to the Department of Homeland Security
* Chile has a cap of 1400 nationals, and Singapore has a cap of 5400 nationals. These are separate from the (often full) H-1B caps, and hence there is no lottery
for H-1B1 applicants.
* Continuing from the previous point, H-1B1 visas can be applied for at any point
of the year, without waiting for a lottery, and without the uncertainty of a lottery.
